# Image Difference Detector

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze and identify the differences between two images. The main use case of this project is to compare a reference image, created from frames of a video, with another image. 

The system uses image processing techniques and algorithms to detect and highlight any discrepancies between the two images. The differences are highlighted with a red bounding box for easy visualization. 

This project is implemented in Python using OpenCV and scikit-image, libraries extensively used for real-time image processing.

## Features

- Analyzes and compares two images.
- Uses superpixels and contours to accurately detect changes and differences.
- Highlights the differences with a bounding box for easy visualization.

## Dependencies

- Python
- OpenCV
- scikit-image
- numpy

## How to Run

1. Install the required Python packages: `pip install opencv-python scikit-image numpy`
2. Run the main script: `python main_script.py`

Please note that this project is under development, and more features are planned for the future. Contributions, suggestions, and issue reports are welcome!

## Future Enhancements

- Improved accuracy and performance of difference detection.
- Support for comparing multiple images.
- Enhanced visualizations and user interface.
- Real-time alerts and notifications for detected differences.
